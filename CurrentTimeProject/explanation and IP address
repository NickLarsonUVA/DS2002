API is running on a public VM.

It’s reachable at:
http://35.199.55.233:5000

Anyone with the correct token can access it from anywhere — fully public.

Important: The API is hosted on a Google Cloud virtual machine. This means the API is only available when the VM is actively running. If the VM is stopped or terminated, the API at http://35.199.55.233:5000 will not be reachable until the VM is restarted and the Flask app is relaunched.

Requirement: "Implement a TOKEN so only authorized tokens can work"
The /api/time/<capital> routes require a token.

If the request does not include the correct token, your API returns
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
